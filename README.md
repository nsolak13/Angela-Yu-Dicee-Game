# Dicee Game
It is a simple dice game we made using HTML, CSS and Javascript in Complete Web Development Bootcamp lessons with Angela Yu.
It is a game played with two players and the one who rolls the highest dice wins, when the page is refreshed.
External CSS and external Script methods were used by linking to the HTML document.
